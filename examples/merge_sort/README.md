### Spreadsheet Merge sort

This is a proof of concept showing how to code merge sort in AutoGRAMS in a spreadsheet. note that for this type of code with loops, conditionals, and recursion, spreadsheets are not the recommended method of implementation--it is far easier to use AutoGRAMS compiled from python. However it can technically be done in a spreadsheet too.
