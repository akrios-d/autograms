"""
This example demonstrates how to build a retrieval-augmented chatbot using the AutoGRAMS framework. 
The chatbot can answer user questions about documentation stored in a local docs folder. 

IMPORTANT:
- This file should NOT contain a main entry point or code that starts the chatbot directly. 
- You will import 'chatbot' from this file into your own run script and execute it there.
- Make sure you have installed:
    pip install autograms
