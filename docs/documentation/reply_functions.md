### Reply Functions


Reply functions are used for giving responses in an Autograms chatbot. These functions pause the program and cause the stack to return to the point before where the first @autograms_function was called. Typically, the entry @autograms_function is wrapped using the Autogram class. A call to a reply function will cause `autogram.reply()` to return. The Memory Object tracks what line in an @autograms_function the reply came from, so that the next time autogram.reply() is called with a new user input, the program will continue from that point--including recalling any @autograms_function s that are needed to re-create the stack from where the reply was given.

There are some similarities between reply() functions and the Python `input` command. `input` also pauses a program to wait for a reply. However with `input` or any other mechanism that pauses the program, the program must continue to run indefinitely while waiting for a response, making it impractical for most chatbot APIs. Autograms reply functions used within @autograms_functions simulate the effect of the `input` command while also allowing the state of the function (and stack trace) to be serialized,, saved, and reloaded from the disk or a database later.
