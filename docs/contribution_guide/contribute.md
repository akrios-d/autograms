
### Contributing to AutoGRAMS

We welcome community contributions to AutoGRAMS


We particularly encourage:

- [Agents](contribute_agents.md) -- additional AutoGRAMS agents to go in the examples folder
- [Python modules](contribute_apis.md) -- additional python modules that can be loaded and called from within an autogram    

See the respective instructions on how to contribute these.

If you would like to contribute to other parts of AutoGRAMS, or would like to collaborate on research with Autograms AI, we recommend contacting us at bkrause@autograms.ai to have a more in depth discussion. 

We would be especially interested in graphical editors for AutoGRAMS that allow them to be created more intuitively, potentially using html in a similar way to our interactive graphs. We are also in the process of developing more standard error messages. If you have other ideas of how to make AutoGRAMS better we would love to hear them.
