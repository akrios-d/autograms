We welcome community contributions to AutoGRAMS, particularly for example [agents](contribute_agents.md) and [python modules](contribute_apis.md). See the respective instructions on how to contribute these.

If you would like to contribute to other parts of AutoGRAMS, or would like to collaborate on research with Autograms AI, we recommend contacting us at bkrause@autograms.ai to have a more detailed discussion. 

We would be especially interested in graphical editors for AutoGRAMS that allow them to be created more intuitively, potentially using html in a similar way to our interactive graphs. However if you have other ideas of how to make AutoGRAMS better we would love to hear them.
